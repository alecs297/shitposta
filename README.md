# shitposta (the original one)

Node.js wenserver serving as a semi-private trash bin in the cloud.

Basically providing an easy way for serving random files from a folder: images, videos, mostly memes.

Pros: auto indexing, autoplay, key shortcuts & filters.
Cons: highly rushed and not safari compatible

> disclaimer, this is not a serious project, only a small tool
